                    <p>Data analysis is a novel approach in college education. The 
                        primary goal for higher education institutions is to provide quality 
                        education for better placement opportunities. By analyzing student 
                        performance, this can predict student selection in placements. This 
                        algorithm helps identify students who are eligible for different 
                        companies. By analyzing student CGPA, skill score, and history of 
                        arrears this can find students eligible for various companies. This system 
                        can be used as an application for placement offers in the college to 
                        manage student information regarding placements.</p>
